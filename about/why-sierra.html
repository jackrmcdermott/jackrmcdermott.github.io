        <p class="paragraph"><span id="why">Why Sierra?</span> &nbsp;I’m Jack, an MBA who’s skeptical of traditional business. It's why I've spent my career working to solve hard problems in growth, marketing, and cutting edge technology.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">At <a href="https://chegg.com/skills" target="_blank"><strong>Chegg Skills</strong></a> (NYSE: CHGG), I've led marketing and growth for a widescale business transformation of a coding bootcamp into an enterprise upskilling solution — resulting in the company's fastest-growing business line.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Before that, I was the first marketing hire at <a href="https://panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>Panorama Education</strong></a> (YC '13). I built out demand generation and product marketing as the company scaled to serve 5M+ users.</p> 

        <p class="paragraph highlight">
          <b>Here's what I'd bring to Writer:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Go-to market leadership — Built and managed team of 6+ direct reports to introduce AI skills programs and generative AI lead gen tools</li>
            <li>Solutions positioning - Created tailored messaging and positioning for insurance, healthcare, and financial services verticals</li>
            <li>AI writing early adopter - Led the rollout of Jasper.ai with training and enablement, accelerating time to market for new blogs, ads, emails, and customer case studies</li>
            <li>Strategic thinking - Successfully pivoted go-to market messaging from product-centric capabilities to solutions-focused outcomes, which increased pipeline growth and product differentiation</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
 
        <p class="paragraph">Outside of work, you'll find me trail running and skiing, or scouting for last-minute concert tickets. I’m a Jumbo, a Wahoo, and a die-hard Patriots fan still relishing their glory days. I live and work in Nashville today with my fiancé and our dog, Mowgli.
