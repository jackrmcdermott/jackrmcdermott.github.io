        <p class="paragraph"><b>Why Highland?</b></p>

        <p class="paragraph">I’m Jack, an MBA with a healthy skepticism for traditional approaches to business. I've dedicated my career to solving complex challenges in education, marketing, and technology.

        <p class="paragraph"><b>Professional Journey</b></p>

        <p class="paragraph">At <a href="https://chegg.com/skills" target="_blank"><strong>Chegg Skills</strong></a> (NYSE: CHGG), I spearheaded marketing and growth initiatives, transforming a coding bootcamp into an enterprise upskilling solution. This work scaled to become the company’s fastest-growing business line. 

        <p class="paragraph">Previously, I was the first marketing hire at <a href="https://panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>Panorama Education</strong></a> (YC '13), where I developed and led demand generation and go-to market strategies. My work there helped the company support over 5 million students in schools nationwide.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>What I Bring to Highland</b></p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Go-to-Market Leadership:</b> I've built and managed a team of over 6+ direct reports, launching growth initiatives and crafting brand awareness.</li>
            <li><b>Solutions Positioning:</b> I crafted tailored messaging and positioning for varied industries including K-12 districts, state agencies, for-profit and NGO partners.</li>
            <li><b>K-12 Innovation & Policy:</b> I led the development of Panorama's voice of customer marketing strategies, navigating local policy concerns and growing public support.</li>
            <li><b>Strategic Thinking:</b> I successfully shifted go-to-market messaging at Chegg from product-centric features to solutions-focused outcomes, enhancing pipeline growth and product differentiation.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>Personal Snapshot</b></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Outside of work, I'm likely hitting the trails, running or skiing, or scouting tickets to the next concert. I’m a proud Jumbo and Wahoo, and a devoted Patriots fan, forever reliving their glory days. These days, I live and work in Nashville with my fiancé and our dog, Mowgli.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I’m excited about the possibility of bringing my skills and passion to Highland, where I believe we can drive forward the future of electrification one local community at a time.</p>
