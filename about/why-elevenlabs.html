        <p class="paragraph"><b>Why ElevenLabs?</b></p> 

        <p class="paragraph">I’m Jack, an MBA with a healthy skepticism for traditional business. It's why I've committed my career to solving complex business challenges through marketing and technology.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Speech holds special meaning for me. Having successfully lived with a speech impediment for my whole life, I recognize the power and potential to unlock voice for the next generation of technology products and services.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>Professional Journey</b></p>

        <p class="paragraph">At <a href="https://chegg.com/skills" target="_blank"><strong>Chegg Skills</strong></a> (NYSE: CHGG), I led product marketing and growth initiatives, transforming a developer bootcamp into an enterprise upskilling solution. I rebuilt our product's messaging and positioning, leading to the fastest-growing business line in the company.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Previously, I was the first marketing hire at <a href="https://panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>Panorama Education</strong></a> (YC '13), where I built our product marketing function and scaled it through the company's growth stage. My efforts helped win new clients and reach more than 5 million students every year.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Before that, I co-founded a <a href="/projects#speech4good" target="_blank"><strong>company</strong></a> while in college to develop speech apps for therapists long before models like ElevenLabs existed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>What I Bring to ElevenLabs</b></p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Product Marketing Leadership:</b> I've built product marketing from the ground floor to the growth stage, recruiting and managing a team of 6+ direct reports.</li>

            <li><b>Positioning Expertise:</b> I crafted tailored messaging and positioning for highly-competitive technical industries with a focus on sales enablement and revenue.</li>

            <li><b>Technical Perspective:</b> I've marketed technical programs to software developers and data scientists, and their teams and enterprise leaders for upmarket growth.</li>

            <li><b>Strategic Thinking:</b> I adapted go-to market strategy and resources with customer success, education, product, and sales to create best-in-class customer experiences.</li>
        
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph"><b>Personal Snapshot</b></p>

        <p class="paragraph">When I'm not working, I'm likely on ski trails or bike routes, or scouting for last-minute concert tickets. I'm a proud Jumbo and Wahoo, and a devoted Patriots fan forever reliving their golden era. These days, I live in Nashville with my fiancé and our dog, Mowgli.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I’m excited about the future of ElevenLabs, where I believe we can drive forward next-generation AI products and services powered by speech.</p>
