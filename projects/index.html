      <p class="paragraph">In 2014, I joined <a href="https://panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>Panorama Education</strong></a> as the company's first marketing hire. I was the Product Marketing Director for the introduction of several new products and services that aimed to improve student outcomes in K-12 schools and districts. Our team led the way in helping educators measure the growth of the "whole child" — including social-emotional learning skills like growth mindset and grit — and I wrote data stories about these topics in <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-03-in-edtech-moving-fast-without-breaking-trust" target="_blank"><strong>EdSurge</strong></a> and <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/finding_common_ground/2016/09/are_we_thinking_about_growth_mindset_too_narrowly.html" target="_blank"><strong>Education Week</strong></a>.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Over five years, I led go-to market strategy and customer development for new products — like <a href="https://panoramaed.com/student-success" target="_blank"><strong>Panorama Student Success</strong></a>, a real-time student data dashboard</a> — that reached millions of students nationwide and I chronicled their impact through customer <a href="https://panoramaed.com/resources/fresno" target="_blank"><strong>documentaries</strong></a>. Later on, I moved to San Francisco to open the company's west coast office. When I left, the company had grown from 8 to 140 employees and served more than 9 million students and 11,500 schools every year.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">During my time at Panorama, I led a team of engineers and educators that shipped the <a href="https://backtoschool.panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>'Get to Know You' Survey</strong></a> — a free online survey that lets students and teachers explore their similarities. More than 100k students and teachers found something in common with one another. We collaborated closely with educational researchers from Harvard to measure efficacy — and this research would later be a feature on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/10/13/444446708/in-the-classroom-common-ground-can-transform-gpas" target="_blank"><strong>NPR's Hidden Brain</strong></a> podcast.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Before that, I co-founded a startup called <strong>Speech4Good</strong> while in college to develop mobile applications for people (like me) with speech impediments. I led product design and marketing for our suite of apps that reached 25k students, parents, and speech therapists. We raised funding from <a href="https://www.roughdraft.vc" target="_blank"><strong>Rough Draft Ventures</strong></a> and were named one of <a href="https://www.inc.com/coolest-college-start-ups-2013/issie-lapowsky/balbus-speech-jack-mcdermott.html?cid=landermore" target="_blank"><strong>Inc.

      <p class="paragraph">As part of Speech4Good, we launched a project called <strong>Fluently</strong> that detected specific moments of disfluent speech — like stuttering — through an iOS app. We collaborated with speech therapists to provide a new way to quantify and monitor speech patterns. This work became more technically difficult than we had hoped, so we sunsetted the project (still one of my favorites) a year later.</p>
