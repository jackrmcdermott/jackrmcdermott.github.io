      <h3 class="section-title">Panorama Education</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">In 2014, I joined <a href="https://panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>Panorama Education</strong></a> as the company's first hire in product marketing. I was the Product Marketing Director for the introduction of several new products and services that aimed to improve student outcomes in K-12 schools and districts. Our team led the way in helping educators measure the growth of the "whole child" — including social-emotional learning skills like growth mindset and grit — and I wrote data stories about these topics in <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-03-in-edtech-moving-fast-without-breaking-trust" target="_blank"><strong>EdSurge</strong></a> and <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/finding_common_ground/2016/09/are_we_thinking_about_growth_mindset_too_narrowly.html" target="_blank"><strong>Education Week</strong></a>.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Over five years, I led go-to market strategy and customer development for new products — like <a href="https://panoramaed.com/student-success" target="_blank"><strong>Panorama Student Success</strong></a>, a real-time student data dashboard</a> — that reached millions of students nationwide and I chronicled their impact through customer <a href="https://panoramaed.com/resources/fresno" target="_blank"><strong>documentaries</strong></a>. Later on, I moved to San Francisco to open the company's west coast office. When I left, the company had grown from 8 to 140 employees and served more than 9 million students and 11,500 schools every year.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">During my time at Panorama, I led a team of engineers and educators to ship the <a href="https://backtoschool.panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>'Get to Know You' Survey</strong></a>. We based the product on research that showed knowing what you have in common with your teacher can lead to higher academic achievement and stronger relationships for students — with even greater effects for students of color. More than 100k students and teachers used the survey to find their similarities over the next few years. We also collaborated with researchers from Harvard to measure efficacy, and their findings were featured on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/10/13/444446708/in-the-classroom-common-ground-can-transform-gpas" target="_blank"><strong>NPR's Hidden Brain</strong></a> podcast.</p>

We raised funding from <a href="https://www.roughdraft.vc" target="_blank"><strong>Rough Draft Ventures</strong></a> and were named one of <a href="https://www.inc.com/coolest-college-start-ups-2013/issie-lapowsky/balbus-speech-jack-mcdermott.html?cid=landermore" target="_blank"><strong>Inc.

      <h3 class="section-title">Fluently</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">As part of Speech4Good, we launched a project called <strong>Fluently</strong> that detected specific moments of disfluent speech — like stuttering — through an iOS app. We collaborated with speech therapists to provide a new way to quantify and monitor speech patterns. This work became more technically difficult than we had hoped, so we sunsetted the project (still one of my favorites) a year later.</p>
