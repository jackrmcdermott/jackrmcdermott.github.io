      <p class="paragraph">While at Panorama, I led a team of engineers, designers, and educators in building the <a href="#"><strong>'Get to Know You' Survey</strong></a> — a free online survey tool that helps students and teachers explore their shared interests and similarities. We based the survey tool on the latest research on teacher-student relationships and, soon enough, more than 100k students found something in common with their teacher. We also worked closely with a research team from Harvard to measure efficacy — their work would later be featured on <a href="#"><strong>NPR's Hidden Brain</strong></a> podcast.</p>
