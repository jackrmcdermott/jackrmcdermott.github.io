      <p class="paragraph">Most recently, I worked as an MBA Summer Fellow with <a href="https://thinkful.com" target="_blank"><strong>Thinkful</strong></a>, an online career accelerator company. My focus there was analyzing new product growth and conducting user research. Our company led the way in helping thousands of adult learners gain new skills during an unprecedented time for education and careers.</p>

I created strategies for student-friendly financing, like income-sharing agreements (ISAs) and deferred tuition, with the goal of expanding access and earnings for adult learners.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Back in 2014, I joined <a href="https://panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>Panorama Education</strong></a> as the company's first marketing hire. I introduced new products and services that aimed to improve student outcomes in K-12 schools and districts. Our team led the way in measuring the growth of the "whole child"—including skills like growth mindset and grit—and I wrote data stories about these topics in <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-03-in-edtech-moving-fast-without-breaking-trust" target="_blank"><strong>EdSurge</strong></a> and <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/finding_common_ground/2016/09/are_we_thinking_about_growth_mindset_too_narrowly.html" target="_blank"><strong>Education Week</strong></a>.</p>

I then moved to San Francisco to open the company's west coast office. When I left, Panorama had grown from 8 to 140 employees and served more than 9 million students in 11,500 schools.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">While at Panorama, I led a team of engineers and educators to build the <a href="https://backtoschool.panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>'Get to Know You' Survey</strong></a>. More than 100k students and teachers used the survey to find out what they have in common with each other. We collaborated with researchers from Harvard to measure efficacy, and their findings were featured on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/10/13/444446708/in-the-classroom-common-ground-can-transform-gpas" target="_blank"><strong>NPR's Hidden Brain</strong></a> podcast.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">As part of Speech4Good, we launched a project called <strong>Fluently</strong> that detected moments of disfluent speech. We collaborated with speech therapists to offer real-time speech analysis. The work became more technically difficult than we had hoped, so we sunsetted the project (still one of my favorites) a year later.</p>
