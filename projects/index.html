      <p class="paragraph">In 2014, I joined <a href="https://panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>Panorama Education</strong></a> as the company's first marketing hire. I was the product marketing manager for the company's introduction of new education technology products and services for K-12 school districts. We launched research-backed surveys to help educators measure student growth in social-emotional learning. These progress that are now the most widely used measures, reaching.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Over the next five years, I led go-to-market strategies and directed the launch of five new products and services — like a student data dashboard called <a href="https://panoramaed.com/student-success" target="_blank"><strong>Panorama Student Success</strong></a> — and chronicled their impact through <a href="https://panoramaed.com/resources/fresno" target="_blank"><strong>success stories</strong></a>. I  then moved to San Francisco to help the company open a west coast office. When I left in 2019, the company had grown from 8 to 140 employees, serving more than 11 million K-12 students every year.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">While at Panorama, I led a team of engineers and educators that shipped the <a href="https://backtoschool.panoramaed.com" target="_blank"><strong>'Get to Know You' Survey</strong></a> — a free online survey that lets students and teachers explore their similarities. More than 100k students and teachers found something in common with one another. We collaborated closely with educational researchers from Harvard to measure efficacy — and this research would later be a feature on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/10/13/444446708/in-the-classroom-common-ground-can-transform-gpas" target="_blank"><strong>NPR's Hidden Brain</strong></a> podcast.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">As a part of Speech4Good, I launched a project called <strong>Fluently</strong> that detected specific moments of disfluent speech — like stuttering — through an iOS app for monitoring by speech therapists. This work turned out to be more technically difficult than we had hoped, so we sunsetted the project (still one of my favorites) about a year later and moved on to our next things.</p>
